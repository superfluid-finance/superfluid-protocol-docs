# 🤖 Deployment

So far in the tutorial we have used contracts already deployed to a public testnet. For simple applications, its totally fine to keep using these contract.

However, you may eventually need the skills to deploy the entire framework yourself to a local test network. Once your Super App is more developed, you will need to write tests. Using a public testnet for testing is not an option, due to the relatively slow execution time. 

> Even a 1 second block time is too long, considering a full test-suite may include thousands of transactions. We need millisecond blocktimes 🏎

### Set up Hardhat

🚧 Under Construction 🚧  We are still working on deployment + testing flow using hardhat. 

...

Now that you're familiar with how to deploy the contracts to a local test network, you are ready to start building a robust Super App with lots of tests. 

> 🛑 Writing tests is not a substitute for having your application audited by a reputable security firm.
